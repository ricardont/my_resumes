## **Summary**
Engineering leader who builds solutions and teams that deliver. I've spent 
10+ years modernizing legacy systems, implementing cloud migrations and 
automation, and leading engineers who ship real results. My focus has always 
been practical: take complex business problems, architect the right technical 
solution, deploy it, make it work. I stay hands-on because I genuinely enjoy 
the technical work; whether that means designing a GCP migration strategy, 
debugging Python code, or figuring out how to integrate Microsoft Dynamics 
with analytics platforms. Work best in environments where I can bridge 
technical execution with business strategy. Core skills: Python, .NET, Ruby on Rails, Google Cloud Platform, enterprise automation. Google Cloud Architect | 
Six Sigma Black Belt.
